## Features

- Data set of over thirty two thousand movie titles
- List wraps seamlessly if you can manage to get to the end of it
- Good spinner physics, where the pegs affect the ticker and the ticker affects the pegs, and the pegs 
- Mobile friendly
- Browser history integration - the movie you spin to is included in the URL so you can go back with your browser's back button
- "Watch Online" link to quickly do a web search for a movie (often you can find a site to it for free easily)
- Ctrl+F to filter the films list by title

## Data Sources

### Wikipedia
I copied from [Wikipedia's alphabetical lists of movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_films#Alphabetical_indices).
I made many edits to normalize the data, and then contributed back to wikipedia, for which someone awarded me The Copyeditor's Barnstar ðŸ˜Š
